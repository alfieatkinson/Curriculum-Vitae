    %    \item \textbf{Developed a console-based library management system} in C++ with CRUD operations for books, users, and transactions using OOP principles.
    %    \item \textbf{Implemented multithreading capabilities} to support concurrent user operations, optimising system performance.
    %    \item \textbf{Designed and integrated networking capabilities} to allow remote interactions.
    %    \item \textbf{Incorporated data persistence mechanisms} to enable reliable storage and retrieval of library data across sessions.
    %    \item \textbf{Built a modular directory structure} with clear separation of concerns, using CMake for build automation and Doxygen for automated documentation generation.
    %    \item \textbf{Adopted Test-Driven Development (TDD)} with Catch2 for robust code through comprehensive unit testing.
